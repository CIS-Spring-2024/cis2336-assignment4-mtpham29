Assignment 4 and 5 include backend javascript and apis. I attempted to do a google map api and made a api key which does not have restrictions, due to me not having google map api on my restrictions tab. 

For the backend javascript I added total of item and quantity while accessing nodejs and importing express and a middleware, body parse. I then defined a post route, retrieved and validated data, calculated the totals, and then started the servers.

For the google map api, I attempted to make a api key and then sourced it to the html. I then clarified the longitude and latitude of UH Sugarland which would then load the map. I added a marker as well.
