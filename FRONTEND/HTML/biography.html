        <h2>Madeleine Pham</h2>
        <p>Madeleine has dedicated many years to teaching young students how to prepare easy meals at home. One of her goals in life is to help every child understand good nutrition and to achieve this goal, she created the Food for Children Program.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Food for Children Program is a program created by Madeleine Pham that not only feeds children who struggle financially, but teaches kids the importance of healthy food. Her weekly events in Houston, Texas cater towards people of all ages, teaching many kids how to cook, what food options are good for the body, and knowledge on food resources, like Food for Children, that make sure everyone is fed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On Madeleine's free time, she spends time with her family and friends. She also likes to exercise and study healthy food options as it is one of her passions. As an eager and hard working person, the next step in Madeleine's journey is to open cafeterias throughout schools within the Greater Houston area.</p>
